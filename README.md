This is a fun retro emulator project of mine. You can download the source code and build with MAKE, then insert your chip-8 games(Rom Files) and have a good time.

## What is CHIP-8
Chip-8 is not a system actually, it's moslty like a Virtual Machine developed in mid 70's Joseph Weisbecker. Games written in the Chip 8 language could easily run on systems that had a Chip 8 interpreter.

## Why am I coded a CHIP-8 Emulator?
becauuusseeee it's fun to! And CHIP-8 is the one of the easiest Emulator project if you new into emulator programming. 

## How to run?
* clone this repo first. 
* go to the repos directory.
